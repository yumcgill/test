\description{
Thall and Vail (1990) give a data set on two-week 
seizure counts for 59 epileptics. The number of seizures was 
recorded for a baseline period of 8 weeks, and then patients 
were randomly assigned to a treatment group or a control group. 
Counts were then recorded for four successive two-week periods. 
The subject's age is the only covariate.
